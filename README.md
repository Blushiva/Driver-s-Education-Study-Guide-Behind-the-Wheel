# Driver's Education Study Guide Behind the Wheel

 This is an extensive study guide written for people who are going to be taking the driving test.  This was written to prepare the person for the Minnesota road test. The links are to videos that will help assist you in learning driving.

 

 ## Things to do to prepare for your test.

 - MAKE SURE YOU ARE DRIVING DAILY. You should be very comfortable behind the wheel. Driving daily builds confidence in the new driver and also builds their skill set quicker.  
 - Drive to practice your driving.  Not just to go to the same place you always go.  Example: school
 - Make Sure to practice your parking Consistantly.  You should be able to park like a professional and not be nervous about it.
 - Make sure that you can explain all the equipment to the examiner on the test.
 - Play the Intersection Game with your co-driver
 - Play the Sign Game with your co-driver
 - 

## Checklist for Road test

You will be expected to know these things on the vehicle and you will have to demonstrate them to the examiner.  

- Seat Adjustment
- Seat Belt
- Emergency Parking Break
- Headlights High and Low beam
- Hazard Warning Lights (4 way Flashers)
- Blinkers/Directionals/Signal Lights
- Horn
- Windsheil Wipers
- Windsheild Defrost (Make sure you understand the difference between the rear and front defroast.)
- Fan Controls
- Mirrors (Interior/Exterior)
- Fuel Gauge

Make sure you can locate and understand how to use these items.  It will be part of the test.  If you miss three you will fail your test and the road test will be canceled. 

## LANE CHANGE AND BLIND SPOTS

To safely change lanes, you should: 
- turn on your turn signal to indicate your intention, 
- check your rearview and side mirrors, check your blind spot by looking over your shoulder on the lane you are merging into, and then smoothly move into the desired lane while maintaining a steady speed;
- remember to turn off your signal once you are fully in the new lane. (DO NOT TAKE FOOT OFF GAS AND LEAN INTO WHEEL WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER.)

The Lane Change is one of the most important skills to learn.  This teaches you to look in your blind spot. It keeps you from hitting other vehicles that may be riding your blindspot.  It makes you aware that cars can hide in that section in the rear window over your shoulder on your right and left side. These cars will not been seen in your mirrors.

## Driving Games

### Intersection Game

With your Co-driver have them ask you where the next intersection is.  This is good to practice to make you aware of your surroundings and scan ahead for issues that may be on the road. Ask them to tell you what they are seeing on the road.

Look for these landmarks on the road:  
- Lines breaking and then starting again
- Street signs
- traffic lights
- vehicles entering or exiting
  

### Sign Game

Have the new driver read the signs as you drive to them.  

### Parking 

I cannot emphasis enough that parking should be something that feels like a second skin to you.  You should practice it until you are so comfortable that you can do it in your sleep.  In this section I will cover parking and the videos behind it.

### The EAGAN DMV Course VIDEO EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT

#### DO NOT BE LIKE THIS GUY!

I have had so many students want me to teach them how to pass in Eagen.  Like Eagan is some cursed area that only the wise can pass the test.  Guess what?  If you practice you will pass.  Then you have the people who post videos like below saying you will pass if you memorize the course.  NOT TRUE!!!!!  He doesn't understand how to drive in a busy area with lots of foot traffic.  He does't understand control of his vehicle or how to maintain a correct speed because he didn't practice driving in a residential area on a grid system.  He was probably only driving on faster roads over 35 and didn't understand lane maintenance and reading the lines on the road as well as the signs at all intersections.  He can't even maintain a consistant speed while driving to these conditions.  This video is not helpful to you guys.  Listen to the experts and practice driving in areas you feel UNCOMFORTABLE in.  Go into Downtown Minneapolis and Downtown St. Paul.  You will get much better experiance and be able to actually drive any course and pass with flying colors.  The key is practice.
