# Lesson 1 Basic Driving

In lesson one we will cover the basics of driving.  This is why it's important to have a consistent driving plan before your first lesson.  You should be comfortable in ANY car and able to take direction while driving.  You should also have a minimum of 15-20 hours of drive time before your first lesson.

  1. Must come to complete stop.

 - Stopping behind a car at the light or stop sign

 Make sure you are about one car length behind the vehicle in front of you. If you can see the bottom of the tire touching the pavement you are stopped perfectly.  If the car inches forward DO NOT INCH WITH THEM.  DO NOT MOVE UNITL THE LIGHT IS GREEN.  This is how the car behind you ends up in your trunk.

## Stop Signs and Stop Lights

 ## Lines on the Road

 - Yellow lines

## LANE CHANGE AND BLIND SPOTS

To safely change lanes, you should: 
- turn on your turn signal to indicate your intention, 
- check your rearview and side mirrors, check your blind spot by looking over your shoulder on the lane you are merging into, and then smoothly move into the desired lane while maintaining a steady speed;
- remember to turn off your signal once you are fully in the new lane. (DO NOT TAKE FOOT OFF GAS AND LEAN INTO WHEEL WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER.)

The Lane Change is one of the most important skills to learn.  This teaches you to look in your blind spot. It keeps you from hitting other vehicles that may be riding your blindspot.  It makes you aware that cars can hide in that section in the rear window over your shoulder on your right and left side. These cars will not been seen in your mirrors.
