# Driver's Education Study Guide Behind the Wheel

 This is an extensive study guide written for people who are going to be taking the driving test.  This was written to prepare the person for the road test. The links are to videos that will help assist you in learning driving.

 ## Things you can do to Prepare for a new driver as a co-driver


 - BlindSpot
 - Make sure the driver leans in and hugs wheel before looking over their shoulder.
 - Adjusting of Mirrors
 - Equipment Demonstration
 - Have the new driver drive for a minimum of 20 hours before taking a behind the wheel lesson. Don't waste your time with a professional instructor driving around a block.  That time is needed to give feedback to the student and instruct them on defensive driving, positioning and control of car.

 ## Things to do to prepare for your test.

 - MAKE SURE YOU ARE DRIVING DAILY. You should be very comfortable behind the wheel. Driving daily builds confidence in the new driver and also builds their skill set quicker.  
 - Drive to practice your driving.  Not just to go to the same place you always go.  Example: school
 - Make Sure to practice your parking Consistantly.  You should be able to park like a professional and not be nervous about it.
 - Make sure that you can explain all the equipment to the examiner on the test.
 - Play the Intersection Game with your co-driver
 - Play the Sign Game with your co-driver
 - 

## Checklist for Road test

You will be expected to know these things on the vehicle and you will have to demonstrate them to the examiner.  

- Seat Adjustment
- Seat Belt
- Emergency Parking Break
- Headlights High and Low beam

Make sure you can locate and understand how to use these items.  It will be part of the test.  If you miss three you will fail your test and the road test will be canceled. 

## Driving Games

### Intersection Game

With your Co-driver have them ask you where the next intersection is.  This is good to practice to make you aware of your surroundings and scan ahead for issues that may be on the road. Ask them to tell you what they are seeing on the road.

Look for these landmarks on the road:  
- Lines breaking and then starting again
- Street signs
- traffic lights
- vehicles entering or exiting

### Sign Game

Have the new driver read the signs as you drive to them.  

### Parking 

I cannot emphasis enough that parking should be something that feels like a second skin to you.  You should practice it until you are so comfortable that you can do it in your sleep.  In this section I will cover parking and the videos behind it.
