# Lesson 1 Basic Driving

In lesson one we will cover the basics of driving.  This is why it's important to have a consistent driving plan before your first lesson.  You should be comfortable in ANY car and able to take direction while driving.  You should also have a minimum of 15-20 hours of drive time before your first lesson.  

## Vehicle Controls

You will be expected to know these things on the vehicle and you will have to demonstrate them to the examiner.  

- Seat Adjustment
- Seat Belt
- Emergency Parking Break
- Headlights High and Low beam
- Hazard Warning Lights (4 way Flashers)
- Blinkers/Directionals/Signal Lights
- Horn
- Windsheil Wipers
- Windsheild Defrost (Make sure you understand the difference between the rear and front defroast.)
- Fan Controls
- Mirrors (Interior/Exterior)
- Fuel Gauge

Make sure you can locate and understand how to use these items.  It will be part of the test.  If you miss three you will fail your test and the road test will be canceled. 


## SIPDE
 Scan Identify Predict Decide Execute

 SIPDE is a five step process that includes the following:

- SEARCH the roadway and the off-road area  20 -30 seconds (about a block to a block and a half) ahead for information that can help you plan your path of travel. Use a systematic search pattern to gather information. First search the road ahead, then to the sides, then glance in your rearview and side mirrors.
- IDENTIFY objects or conditions with 12-15 seconds ahead that could interfere with your path of travel. To identify important information as a driver, you must do more than just LOOK. You must think about what you are looking for; things like stalled cars on the side of the road, pedestrians waiting to cross the street, and cars coming up too fast behind you are all important information.
- PREDICT what actions or changes in conditions on or near the roadway could increase your level of risk. As you search the roadway and see the positions of the vehicles and pedestrians, try to predict what you would do in certain circumstances. For instance, the car behind you that is coming up too fast might not be able to stop. You need to think – before that car rear-ends you – in order to make a decision to move to another lane to avoid a crash.
- DECIDE what action or actions to take (such as reduce speed, increase speed,  brake or steer clear) 4 to 5 seconds ahead of time to control or reduce risk. Once you have identified a potential threat you can decide how best to minimize the risk of a collision. Keep in mind most situations allow you a choice of actions, such as moving to another lane to avoid a rear-end collision, or taking the ditch to the right rather than taking a head-on hit.
- Execute your decision. The final step is to execute the decision you have made. In most instances, executing a decision simply means making a routine maneuver.
Practicing the SIPDE process during your driver training process will help new drivers become smarter, more defensive drivers. If you have a new teen driver and want to make their behind the wheel practice less stressful and more successful,



 ## Three Second Rule

The three-second rule is a driving technique that recommends maintaining a safe following distance between your vehicle and the one ahead. The rule helps you avoid rear-ending the car in front of you if they brake suddenly. 

How to use the three-second rule: 
- Choose a roadside marker, like a tree or sign
Note when the car ahead passes the marker
- Count how many seconds it takes you to pass the same marker
If it's less than three seconds, increase your following distance

When to increase the following distance: 
- You should increase the following distance when driving in adverse conditions, such as heavy traffic or bad weather.
  
Why is the three-second rule important?
- The three-second rule gives you time to recognize a hazard and respond safely. This can help you avoid rear-end collisions, which can be more serious than you might think. 
You can also watch this video to learn more about the three-second rule:

## Lane Change

### REMEBER LEAN INTO YOUR WHEEL WHEN LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER

Changing Lanes: What To Do

Step #1: Turn on your turn signal.
Turn signals are the only way you can let other drivers know that you'll be changing lanes. Traffic School Online reports that you are legally required to activate your turn signals at least 100 feet before making your move. Using your blinker to signal your intent to change lanes, merge into traffic, and even turn into a parking spot can help keep you safe and ticket-free. Plus, when you're in a traffic jam, using your turn signal may be the only way to "ask" another driver to let you in ahead of them.

Step #2: Check your rearview and side mirrors.
After activating your blinker, take a look into your rearview and side mirror to ensure you have enough space to make the lane change. If there's a car in the lane you're merging into, wait until you can see the entire vehicle (wheels included) and a few feet of pavement in front of it in your rearview mirror.

- At this point, if the other car is going at or below the same speed as you are, you should have enough room to change lanes. It's essential to keep an eye on the speed of the car you're trying to merge ahead of — if they're accelerating, you are better off letting them pass you before changing lanes (as the space for your car is quickly closing).

While some states allow drivers to speed when passing slow vehicles, doing so isn't always in your best interest. Speeding is one of the fastest ways to increase your risk of an accident.

Step #3: Look over your shoulder to check your blind spot.
Even after checking your mirrors, there's a spot behind the car that you can't see – and that spot could easily contain a car or motorcycle! Immediately after checking your mirrors, look over your right shoulder to ensure you don't miss anything. Always remember when checking your mirrors and blind spot that it's easy to miss smaller objects, like cyclists, so keep your eyes peeled. Additionally, you can better avoid getting hit by not lingering in other drivers' blind spots.

Step #4: Change lanes!
Once you've determined that it is safe to change lanes, it's time to go for it! Maintain your speed and glide into the lane smoothly.

Step #5: Turn your turn signal off.
Don't be that person driving down the highway with your turn signal blinking. As soon as you're in your desired lane, turn off your blinker.


 ## Proper Lane Usage

 Proper lane usage means driving in the correct lane for the current conditions, and following the rules of the road. 

General lane usage:  
- Drive in the lane with the smoothest traffic flow.
- Use the right lane for slower speeds, entering or exiting traffic, or turning right.
- Use the left lane for passing, turning left, or going faster.
- After passing, return to the right lane.
- Don't weave between lanes.
  
Passing:
- Use the left lane to pass other vehicles while obeying the speed limit. 
- If you're following a slower vehicle, let them pass safely. 
- If you spot someone blocking the left lane, don't pass on the right. 

Speed: 
- If other drivers are going faster than the speed limit, slow down and move to the right.
- Never exceed the legal speed limit.

Other tips: 
- Keep other vehicles out of your blind spots.
- Position your vehicle to keep up with the traffic flow.

 ## Left turns

 ## Right Turns

 ## Proper Stopping and Distance

Stop Signs and Stop Lights
  1. Must come to complete stop.  
  2. Passenger Needs to rest and settle in seat.  
  3. At that point Look to your left for cars and movement.  
  4. Then look to your Right for cars and movement
  5. And then to your left again checking one last time.
  6. Go if everything is clear

Stopping behind a car at the light or stop sign

 Make sure you are about one car length behind the vehicle in front of you. If you can see the bottom of the tire touching the pavement you are stopped perfectly.  If the car inches forward DO NOT INCH WITH THEM.  DO NOT MOVE UNITL THE LIGHT IS GREEN.  This is how the car behind you ends up in your trunk.

## Stop Signs and Stop Lights

 - obstructed view at stop sign or light
 

 ## Lines on the Road

 - Yellow lines
 - white lines
 - solid lines
 - solid on one side dashed on the other
 - crosswalks 
 - bike lanes

## LANE CHANGE AND BLIND SPOTS

To safely change lanes, you should: 
- turn on your turn signal to indicate your intention, 
- check your rearview and side mirrors, check your blind spot by looking over your shoulder on the lane you are merging into, and then smoothly move into the desired lane while maintaining a steady speed;
- remember to turn off your signal once you are fully in the new lane. (DO NOT TAKE FOOT OFF GAS AND LEAN INTO WHEEL WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER.)

The Lane Change is one of the most important skills to learn.  This teaches you to look in your blind spot. It keeps you from hitting other vehicles that may be riding your blindspot.  It makes you aware that cars can hide in that section in the rear window over your shoulder on your right and left side. These cars will not been seen in your mirrors.

## Driving Games

### Intersection Game

With your Co-driver have them ask you where the next intersection is.  This is good to practice to make you aware of your surroundings and scan ahead for issues that may be on the road. Ask them to tell you what they are seeing on the road.

Look for these landmarks on the road:  
- Lines breaking and then starting again
- Street signs
- traffic lights
- vehicles entering or exiting
  

### Sign Game

Have the new driver read the signs as you drive down the road to them.  

 
 ## Defensive driving

### Parking 

I cannot emphasis enough that parking should be something that feels like a second skin to you.  You should practice it until you are so comfortable that you can do it in your sleep.  In this section I will cover parking and the videos behind it.
