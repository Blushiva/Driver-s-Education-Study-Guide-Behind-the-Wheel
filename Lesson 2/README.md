# Lesson 2 Freeway Driving

## Things to achieve before Lesson 2

- By this lesson you should have a minimum of 5 hours of drive time just on the freeway before this lesson.
- You should be able to switch lanes confidently.  You should be checking blind spots and everything else that was covered in lesson 1.  (Please review lesson 1 README.MD File Lane Changes) If your instructor didn't cover it, it was probably because they needed to focus you on a different area that needed immediate attention please ask them to cover it.
- We should also be going over all the main points of lesson 1 again but at an accelerated pace.
- PLEASE REVIEW LESSON #1 

### What is the diffence between a Highway and a Freeway?

A "highway" is a general term for a major road connecting towns or cities, while a "freeway" is a specific type of highway designed for high-speed, uninterrupted travel with controlled access, meaning no traffic lights or direct access from side roads, making it ideal for fast, continuous movement; essentially, all freeways are highways, but not all highways are freeways. 

Key points about the difference: 
- Access control:
Freeways have controlled access with on-ramps and off-ramps, while highways can have direct access from side roads with traffic lights aka controlled and uncontrolled intersections. 
- Traffic flow:
Freeways are designed for smooth, high-speed traffic with minimal interruptions, whereas highways may have traffic signals and intersections. 
- General usage:
"Highway" is a broader term encompassing various major roads, while "freeway" refers specifically to a high-speed, controlled-access road without intersections.
- Highways and freeways may have an additional third or even fourth lane for one direction of traffic. The number always increases with the traffic flow. In a three-lane freeway, the right lane is meant for exiting and entering the roadways, while the left one is for passing only. *So, you should really only use the middle lane*.
- Use cruise control when possible to increase fuel efficiency and avoid unnecessary slow-downs and speed-ups.
- Stay at the speed limit.  Don't contribute to the traffic problem.  Studies have shown that driving the speed limit while maintaining "the 3 second rule" reduces congestion on the freeway.  It creates a bubble around you where you are not nervous or tail-gaiting and you are less stressed and less likely to make a mistake.

## PROPER USE OF THE FREEWAY/HIGHWAY LANE

On a Highway/Freeway, the right lane is typically used for entering, exiting, and slower traffic, while the left lane is primarily for passing and faster-moving vehicles; meaning you should "keep right except to pass" - always stay in the right lane unless you are actively overtaking another vehicle. 

Key points about freeway lane usage:
- Right lane: For entering, exiting, and slower speeds.
- Left lane: For passing only, used to overtake slower vehicles.
- Middle lanes: Used for through traffic, maintaining a consistent speed. 

Important considerations:
- Do not linger in the left lane: Once you have passed a vehicle, move back to the right lane promptly. It is ILLEAGAL IN MN.
- Check your mirrors and blind spots: Always signal before changing lanes to ensure it is safe to move. 
- Be aware of lane markings and signs: Some freeways may have specific lane usage rules indicated by signs. 


### Carpool Lane

Carpool lanes, also known as High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, are typically used by vehicles with a minimum number of occupants. Other vehicles that may be permitted include motorcycles, buses, and some low-emission vehicles. 

Who can use HOV lanes?
- Carpools: Vehicles with two or more occupants are usually permitted in HOV lanes 
- Buses: Public transit buses are often allowed in HOV lanes 
- Motorcycles: Motorcycles are generally permitted in HOV lanes across the United States 
- Low-emission vehicles: Some low-emission or electric vehicles can use HOV lanes with a single occupant
  
Other HOV lane restrictions:
- Large trucks and vehicles towing trailers are often prohibited from using HOV lanes 
- HOV lanes are usually located next to the regular, or unrestricted, lanes 
- HOV lanes are intended to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution 

## HOW TO ENTER A FREEWAY

1. Look for the freeway entrance sign.
Freeway entrances usually have entrance ramps, and acceleration lanes and merge areas.
The first area of a freeway entrance is the entrance ramp.
When you enter a freeway, look for the freeway guide signs that provide you information about the freeway route number and direction or destination of the highway.

2. Make sure that you are not entering the freeway exit ramp.
If you are on what you believe to be an entrance ramp, but you see a DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY sign, pull over immediately.
Turn around when you can, and get off of the ramp.

3. Follow the freeway entrance's speed limit.
Look for the speed limit on the entrance ramp. Some of the entrance ramps have speed limits due to their sharp curves, so be careful and drive slowly and at a safe speed on sharp curves.

4. Follow the freeway entrance's ramp meters signal lights.
On some of the freeway entrances, there are ramp meters (ramp signals) with two states: green and red. The ramp meters are used to control the flow of traffic on a busy highway.

Ramp meters allow one or two cars to pass per green light. Read the signs that provide information about the number of cars that is allowed to pass at each green light. Always arrive at a full stop at the ramp signal until it turns green.

5. Accelerate to a safe speed close to the flow of freeway traffic.
When you are on the entrance ramp, be prepared to accelerate to a safe speed close to the flow of freeway traffic and begin checking for the opening.

The entrance ramp shortly turns into the acceleration lane and merging area. Once you are in the acceleration lane, start speeding up to a safe speed close to the flow of freeway traffic, and begin planning on merging onto the freeway.

6. Merge into the freeway lane.
Shortly after the acceleration lane, you are in the merging area. Turn on your signals, look over your mirrors and shoulders and look for an opening to merge onto the freeway.

### Lane changes (Advanced)

We want you to continue practicing your lane change.  If you are taking your foot off the gas or not understanding how to merge correctly or let others merge.  Or if you just can't maintain your speed consistently, we will assist you with understanding this concept.    

SEE LESSON 1 ON HOW TO LANE CHANGE

Changing Lanes: What Not To Do

- Mistake #1: Take too long to do all the steps.
Things change quickly on the road, and you should do every step within a couple of seconds of the other.

- Mistake #2: Forget to activate or deactivate your turn signal.
Your turn signal is your voice on the road. Using your turn signal alerts other cars that you're making a move. Leaving it on after you've merged or turning it on when you're halfway through a turn is confusing and potentially dangerous!

- Mistake #3: Brake or slow down before changing lanes.
When changing lanes, you should continue going with the flow of traffic. That means maintaining your speed when merging, and then catching up to the speed of the lane that you move into — whether that means slowing down or accelerating a bit.

- Mistake #4: Drift while checking your blind spot. LEAN INTO YOUR WHEEL WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER.
A quick check is all you need. Once you've made sure your blind spot is clear, you must get your eyes back on the road. After all, you don't want to merge into another vehicle's rear end!

- Mistake #5: WHEN ON FREEWAY Merging onto the freeway before the car in front of you merges.
When you merge onto a freeway, the cars that are already moving have the right of way, which means they are not legally required to make space for you to enter the lane. You are responsible for finding a gap. While you are watching the cars on the highway, don’t forget to pay attention to the cars in front of you. If you aren’t watching closely, you could end up rear ending another vehicle. It’s safer to let the car in front of you merge first, then look for your chance to merge into traffic.

### READING THE LINES ON THE ROAD

To read the lines on the highway, understand that white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction, while yellow lines separate traffic moving in opposite directions; solid lines indicate you should stay within your lane, while broken lines allow you to change lanes when safe to do so; pay particular attention to the pattern of solid and broken lines to determine passing rules on the road. 

Key points about Highway lines:

White lines:
- Solid white line: Stay within your lane, often marking the edge of the road. 
- Broken white line: You can change lanes when safe to do so.
- Small short Square Lines:  Lane is coming to an end, merge over or exit.

Yellow lines:
- Solid yellow line: Do not cross the center line to pass. 
- Broken yellow line: You can pass when the broken line is on your side.
- Double solid yellow lines: Indicates no passing allowed in either direction. 
- Solid yellow line with a broken yellow line: Only pass when next to the broken line.
