# Lesson 2 Freeway Driving

## Things to achieve before Lesson 2

- By this lesson you should have a minimum of 5 hours of drive time just on the freeway before this lesson.
- You should be able to switch lanes confidently.  You should be checking blind spots and everything else that was covered in lesson 1.  (Please review lesson 1 README.MD File Lane Changes) If your instructor didn't cover it, it was probably because they needed to focus you on a different area that needed immediate attention please ask them to cover it.
- We should also be going over all the main points of lesson 1 again but at an accelerated pace.  

### What is the diffence between a Highway and a Freeway?

A "highway" is a general term for a major road connecting towns or cities, while a "freeway" is a specific type of highway designed for high-speed, uninterrupted travel with controlled access, meaning no traffic lights or direct access from side roads, making it ideal for fast, continuous movement; essentially, all freeways are highways, but not all highways are freeways. 

Key points about the difference: 
- Access control:
Freeways have controlled access with on-ramps and off-ramps, while highways can have direct access from side roads with traffic lights aka controlled and uncontrolled intersections. 
- Traffic flow:
Freeways are designed for smooth, high-speed traffic with minimal interruptions, whereas highways may have traffic signals and intersections. 
- General usage:
"Highway" is a broader term encompassing various major roads, while "freeway" refers specifically to a high-speed, controlled-access road without intersections.
- Highways and freeways may have an additional third or even fourth lane for one direction of traffic. The number always increases with the traffic flow. In a three-lane freeway, the right lane is meant for exiting and entering the roadways, while the left one is for passing only. *So, you should really only use the middle lane*.
- Use cruise control when possible to increase fuel efficiency and avoid unnecessary slow-downs and speed-ups.
- Stay at the speed limit.  Don't contribute to the traffic problem.  Studies have shown that driving the speed limit while maintaining "the 3 second rule" reduces congestion on the freeway.  It creates a bubble around you where you are not nervous or tail-gaiting and you are less stressed and less likely to make a mistake.

### Lane changes (Advanced)

We want you to continue practicing your lane change.  If you are taking your foot off the gas or not understanding how to merge correctly or let others merge.  Or if you just can't maintain your speed consistently, we will assist you with understanding this concept.    


### READING THE LINES ON THE ROAD

To read the lines on the freeway, understand that white lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction, while yellow lines separate traffic moving in opposite directions; solid lines indicate you should stay within your lane, while broken lines allow you to change lanes when safe to do so; pay particular attention to the pattern of solid and broken lines to determine passing rules on the road. 

Key points about freeway lines:

White lines:
- Solid white line: Stay within your lane, often marking the edge of the road. 
- Broken white line: You can change lanes when safe to do so.
- Small short Square Lines:  Lane is coming to an end, merge over or exit.

Yellow lines:
- Solid yellow line: Do not cross the center line to pass. 
- Broken yellow line: You can pass when the broken line is on your side.
- Double solid yellow lines: Indicates no passing allowed in either direction. 
- Solid yellow line with a broken yellow line: Only pass when next to the broken line.
