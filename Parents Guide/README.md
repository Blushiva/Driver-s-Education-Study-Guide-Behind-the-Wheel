## Things you can do to Prepare for a new driver as a co-driver/Parent/Guardian

To prepare a new driver, a Parent/Guardian/Co-Driver can: provide extensive supervised driving practice in various conditions, emphasize the importance of following traffic laws, discuss the dangers of distractions, set clear rules and expectations, lead by example with safe driving habits, limit nighttime driving initially, ensure the car is in good condition, and talk openly about responsible driving behaviors like not driving under the influence;. 

- Thorough driving lessons:
Go beyond the required driving education by providing additional practice in different environments, including highways, busy streets, and parking lots. 
Safety first:
- Continuously stress the importance of wearing seatbelts, obeying speed limits, and maintaining a safe following distance. 
- Distraction awareness:
- Discuss the dangers of using phones, eating, or engaging in other distracting activities while driving. 
- Set clear boundaries:
- Establish rules regarding passenger limits, curfew, driving in adverse weather, and when to avoid driving altogether. 
- Be a good role model:
Demonstrate responsible driving habits by following traffic laws and avoiding risky behaviors yourself. 
- Gradual progression:
Start with simpler driving scenarios and gradually introduce more complex situations as the new driver gains confidence. 
- Vehicle maintenance:
Regularly check the car's condition, including tire pressure, lights, and fluid levels, to ensure safe operation. 
- Open communication:
Have open conversations about driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, fatigue, and the importance of reporting any concerns.
- Practice makes a (nearly) perfect driver. No one becomes good at something after doing it for just a few hours. Your child needs at least two hours of practice driving each week for six months to reach a level of proficiency. Try to have them drive a minimum of 3 times a week.
- The dangers of texting. Hundreds of people die every month because a driver got distracted while behind the wheel. Teach your child to keep their eyes on the road and their minds focused.

To Prepare them before their first behind the wheel:
 - BlindSpots understand them
 - Understand how to teach a lane change
 - Make sure the driver leans in and hugs wheel before looking over their shoulder.
 - Adjusting of Mirrors
 - Equipment Demonstration
 - Have the new driver drive for a minimum of 20 hours before taking a behind the wheel lesson. Don't waste your time with a professional instructor driving around a block.  That time is needed to give feedback to the student and instruct them on defensive driving, positioning and control of car.
